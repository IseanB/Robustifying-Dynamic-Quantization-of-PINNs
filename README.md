# Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)

## Transforming Physics with Neural Networks

Welcome to the **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** project, where the realms of deep learning and the fundamental principles of physics converge to tackle some of the most complex challenges in computational science. This repository offers an advanced framework designed not only to solve intricate physical problems but to do so in a manner that inherently respects and incorporates the laws of nature.

## Why Physics-Informed Neural Networks?

Traditional numerical methods for solving differential equations can be computationally intensive and often fall short in terms of accuracy, especially in high-dimensional spaces or complex domains. **PINNs** leverage the power of neural networks to create models that can learn from both data and physical laws, resulting in solutions that are not only efficient but also grounded in reality. This synergy opens doors to new possibilities across various scientific fields.

  Implementations of physics-informed loss functions that directly align with well-established physical equations, allowing for:
  - **Schrödinger Equation:** Modeling quantum systems.
  - **Maxwell's Equations:** Understanding electromagnetic fields.
  - **Heat Equation:** Analyzing thermal dynamics.
  - **Wave Equation:** Capturing wave propagation phenomena.
  - **Navier-Stokes Equations:** Solving fluid dynamics challenges.

- **Dynamic and Flexible Architecture:**  
  A customizable neural network framework supports a diverse range of activation functions:
  - **Tanh:** Enhanced with numerical stability techniques to mitigate overflow issues.
  - **ReLU and Leaky ReLU:** Optimized for sparse data and ensuring gradient flow.
  - **Sigmoid:** For scenarios requiring probabilistic outputs.

- **State-of-the-Art Numerical Stability:**  
  With advanced numerical techniques integrated, our PINN framework ensures robust performance, even under challenging conditions where traditional methods may falter.

- **Multi-Dimensional Input Capabilities:**  
  This project is designed to handle inputs in multiple dimensions, allowing researchers to explore intricate systems and phenomena beyond conventional boundaries.
